<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Farzana Mannan. I live in the UK. I am originally from Bangladesh. I love both the UK and Bangladesh. I have a beautiful family, alhamdulillah. I work as a manager in a well-known retail company in the UK. 
  However, because of my interest in doing something online, I have decided to start learning web development.</p>

<p>I am a person who makes decisions very carefully. I don't just dive into anything. Before starting my web development course, I did a little bit of research to understand the potential of pursuing this course.
  In other words, I wanted to know whether, by completing this course, I would be able to start my career in the tech world.</p>

<p>My efforts in research have led me to understand that there is a great possibility of having a successful career by enriching my knowledge in web development. 
  Honestly, I am now fully confident that I will be able to build a successful career as a web developer by completing my course.</p>
